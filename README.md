## 📖 About

This repository hosts my implementations of algorithms, data structures, and competitive programming solutions.  
It serves both as a reference for myself and as a resource others can browse through to learn, compare, or use directly.

## 📂 Repository Layout

Here’s a high‑level look at how the project is organized:
/
├── Algorithms/ ← General algorithm implementations
├── Arrays/ ← Array & vector problems
├── Binary-Trees/ ← Tree / BST solutions
├── Binary_Search/ ← Binary search methods
├── Bit-Manipulation/ ← Bitwise algorithm tricks
├── DP-Recursion/ ← Dynamic programming & recursion
├── Graph/ ← Graph algorithms (BFS, DFS, MST, etc.)
├── Greedy/ ← Greedy strategy problems
├── Hash-Map/ ← Hashing, maps & dictionaries
├── Linked-Lists/ ← Singly/doubly linked list code
├── Math/ ← Math / number theory utilities
├── Matrix/ ← Matrix operations & transforms
├── Priority-Queue/ ← Heap, priority queue algorithms
├── Sliding-Window/ ← Sliding window technique problems
├── String/ ← String algorithms / pattern matching
└── stack/ ← Stack / monotonic stack problems


> Each folder contains `.cpp` or `.py` files focused on that topic.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Languages

- **C++** — main language used across all problem-solving  
- **Python** — occasionally used for scripting and quick solutions  

Tools often used:  
- GCC / G++  
- VS Code / Vim  
- Online judges (Codeforces, LeetCode, AtCoder, etc.)
